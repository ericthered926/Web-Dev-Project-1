# Project 1

IS 542 Project 1: The Scriptures, Mapped
I learned quite a bit doing Project 1. I went through all the videos and raced to figure out how to integrate with the different apis and JSON
requests. I learned the importance of JSLint and how to use it. I'm amazed at how picky it can be, but I'm grateful for what it can do. I spent
a lot more time working on this than I thought I would, but it ended up being a good learning experience, and I hope to be able to get a better
grasp on some of the concepts used in this project. I'm amazed at how easy it is for Dr. Liddle to just do this code on the fly. I am definitely
not at a point where I can just think of what I want to code and get it done without lots of Googling and trial and error.
